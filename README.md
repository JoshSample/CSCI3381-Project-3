# CSCI3381-Project-3
Project 3, create a website for our back end.
This project is a continuation of what I have worked on in my Java class. Instead of making a gui and creating a runnable application, this uses Apache Tomcat and runs on a server. This project uses HTML and JSP pages to navigate and manage patient data.
This was made through Eclipse IDE and ran on the Apache Tomcat server.
